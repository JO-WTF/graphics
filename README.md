Python Text Based Graphics Module
=================================

This is a console based graphics engine for simple ASCII games or animations.

`console.py` is a small script to determine the terminal size. Works in my gnome-terminal in Debian, probably wont work in all environments, was not written by me, I think it came off a stack overflow.

`colors.py` has functions for adding the correct escapes to strings to color them, also off stack overflow, also not sure about environment support.
